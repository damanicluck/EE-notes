\section{Practice Problems}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume that the following circuits have the same large signal operating points and that $V_{tn}$ = 1V (without body bias), $k-n = \frac{\mu C_{ox} W}{L} = 10^{-3}$ A/V\sq, $\lambda = 0$, $\gamma = 0.5$ V$^{1/2}$, and $\phi_p = $ \SI{-400}{\milli \V}. $C_{big}$ means that the AC-coupling capacitor is so large that the lower bandwidth it imposes is far below any signal we are interested in and we can treat it as a short circuit for small-signal calculations (while still keeping it an open circuit for DC biasing calculations).
