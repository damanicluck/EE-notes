# EE-notes

This is meant to store my notes for future reference, so I can review if necessary. Because of this, it was written in a way that makes the most sense to me. Sources have been written down for each chapter to the best of my ability. I've referenced a lot of stuff and honestly this is for my person reference so I don't take credit for practice problems here.
