\section{Charge Carriers and Doping}
We start learning about resistors, capacitors, and inductors from earlier courses such as EECS 16A and 16B. With more components like transistors, diodes, and op-amps (which are all based on semiconductors), we are able to expand upon circuit design. We need to understand semoconductor physics in order to understand how these components operate.

\end{center}


Doping is one method that we use in semiconductor devices to introduce more or fewer electrons, which change conductivity. The following materials are commonly used:
\begin{pline}
    \item Group III elements: $\rightarrow$ acceptors
    \item Group IV elements: germanium and silicon
    \item Group V elements: $\rightarrow$ donors
\end{pline}
